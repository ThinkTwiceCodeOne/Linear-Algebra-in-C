# MatrixOperation

This is a C library which has essential matrix operations. 
Right now it has 
1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Determinant of matrix
5. Trace of matrix
6. Transpose of matrix
7. Inverse of matric (Gauss Jordan Method)
8. Roots of linear equations (Gauss Jordan Method)
9. Rank of matrix
10. Covariance of matrix
11. MultiplyByScalar
    
I'll keep adding more
